# 2019-OSS-Summer-RL

2019-OSS-Summer-RL is the material(lecture notes, examples and assignments) repository for reinforcement learning basic course that I have taught at Kookmin University in the summer of 2019. Note that examples and assignments in this repository uses [Keras](https://keras.io/).
